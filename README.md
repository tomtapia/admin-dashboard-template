# Admin Dashboard Template

A production-shaped **React 19 + Vite 6 + TypeScript** admin dashboard starter — 13 fully wired module pages, multi-tenancy, RBAC, theming, i18n, and a complete in-browser mock API so it runs with **zero backend**, then drops onto your real API with a single env var.

**Live demo:** [admin-dashboard-template.vercel.app](https://admin-dashboard-template.vercel.app) — rebuilt and redeployed automatically on every release.

## About

Standing up an internal admin console usually means weeks of plumbing before the first real feature: session handling, tenant scoping, data tables, theme tokens, loading/error states, accessibility, and a test pipeline. This template makes those decisions for you — and proves them with unit and end-to-end tests.

Every screen runs against a [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io) API layer, so the app is a fully interactive product demo out of the box. When it's time for production, set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` and the same `/api/*` requests flow straight to your backend — no feature-code changes required.

## Key Features

- **13 routed pages** — Overview, Analytics, Users, Team, Billing, Transactions, Notifications, Support, Integrations, Settings, User Settings, Login, 404 — all lazy-loaded behind a protected shell.
- **Multi-tenancy built in** — every request is scoped with an `X-Tenant-Id` header; a branded workspace switcher lives at the top of the sidebar and mobile nav.
- **Production-shaped auth** — access/refresh tokens, automatic `401 → refresh → retry`, silent refresh on load, and redirect-to-login on failure.
- **Role-based access control** — nav visibility and route guards gated by Owner / Admin / Manager through a single `canAccess()` source of truth.
- **Four theme presets** (Core Light, Midnight Ops, Sunset Ember, Forest Deep) driven by CSS variables, honoring `prefers-color-scheme` by default.
- **Internationalized** — English, Spanish, and French bundles via `react-i18next`, switchable per user.
- **Resilient UX contract** — skeleton-first loading (no spinner page-swaps), retryable error panels, confirm dialogs with **Undo** toasts, and zero decorative buttons.
- **Accessible to WCAG 2.2 AA** — skip link, focus management on navigation, keyboard-operable tables, sr-only chart data tables, AA-contrast tokens, `prefers-reduced-motion`; enforced by jest-axe in CI.
- **Observability-ready** — Sentry error reporting activates lazily when `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` is set; console fallback otherwise.
- **Quality pipeline** — Vitest (jsdom) + Playwright suites, Biome lint/format, Husky pre-commit, and a GitHub Actions gate (typecheck → lint → test → build → e2e).
- **⌘K command palette** — fuzzy page navigation, theme switching, and account actions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

| Tool   | Version |
| ------ | ------- |
| Node.js | ≥ 22 |
| pnpm    | ≥ 11 |

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Get the code (or click "Use this template" on GitHub)
git clone <your-repo-url> admin-dashboard
cd admin-dashboard

# 2. Install dependencies
pnpm install
```

### Quickstart — running in under 2 minutes

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Then:

1. Open **http://localhost:5173** — unauthenticated visits redirect to `/login`.
2. Click **Enter dashboard** — the mock sign-in issues a real-shaped access/refresh token session (no credentials needed).
3. You land on the Overview. Press **⌘K / Ctrl+K** to explore the command palette, or switch workspaces from the top of the sidebar.

The MSW worker starts automatically in dev, so all data, invites, and mutations work immediately against seeded fixtures.

## Usage & Examples

### Everyday commands

```bash
pnpm dev          # Vite dev server + MSW worker
pnpm build        # tsc -b typecheck + vite build -> dist/
pnpm preview      # serve the production build
pnpm test         # Vitest suite (unit/integration, jsdom)
pnpm e2e          # Playwright suite (boots pnpm dev automatically)
pnpm typecheck    # tsc -b alone
pnpm lint         # Biome check
pnpm format       # Biome format --write .
```

### Point it at a real backend

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

```dotenv
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=            # optional: enables Sentry error reporting
VITE_APP_ENV=production     # optional: tags Sentry events
```

Build and deploy `dist/` to any static host (Vercel, Netlify, S3 + CloudFront…). Production builds never start the MSW worker — just implement the same `/api/*` paths defined in [`src/mocks/handlers.ts`](src/mocks/handlers.ts).

### Restrict a feature by role

RBAC is wired in two places, both backed by [`src/lib/rbac.ts`](src/lib/rbac.ts):

```ts
// src/components/layout/nav-items.ts — hide the nav entry
{ title: "Audit Log", href: "/app/audit", icon: "scroll-text", roles: ["Owner", "Admin"] }
```

```tsx
// src/app/router.tsx — guard the route itself
<RoleRoute roles={["Owner", "Admin"]}>
  <Suspense>{/* <AuditPage /> */}</Suspense>
</RoleRoute>
```

Unauthorized roles are redirected to `/app/overview`. Note this is client-side gating only — enforce authorization on your backend.

Imports always use the `@/` path alias (mapped to `src/`).

## Roadmap / Status

**Status:** actively developed, pre-1.0. Releases are cut locally with [Commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/) (`czg bump`) and documented in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md); publishing a release also deploys the live demo to Vercel.

Recently shipped (v0.3–v0.4): tenancy scoping, token refresh lifecycle, i18n, Sentry foundation, and a full UX/a11y overhaul (skeletons, undo flows, command palette, keyboard-accessible tables).

Candidate milestones toward **v1.0**:

- Hardened production auth story (server-issued sessions instead of `localStorage` tokens)
- Documented server-side authorization contract alongside the client RBAC
- Coverage reporting wired into CI
- Additional themes and locale bundles
